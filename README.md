# TouchDesigner + Luxonis Starter Kit

Welcome! This project is designed to help you get started with machine learning in **TouchDesigner** using **Luxonis OAK-D** cameras and **Mediapipe** pipelines. Whether you're into interactive visuals, installations, or just curious about real-time ML, this repo has tools and examples built to lower the barrier.

## What This Is

This repo is a collection of ready-to-use **TouchDesigner patches** that integrate real-time ML features like:

- Hand tracking
- Face mesh
- Depth data + point clouds

All examples are designed to work **without needing a high-end GPU** — just plug in a Luxonis OAK-D camera and go. Each patch is organized and includes a short video walkthrough to help you understand what’s happening under the hood.

## How to use it 
1. Download TouchDesigner from [Derivative](https://derivative.ca/)
2. Download Mediapipe from [this repo](https://github.com/torinmb/mediapipe-touchdesigner) OR plug in a Luxonis Oak-d camera
4. Clone this repository and open the .toe files
   
I highly recommend you explore, take apart, destroy, rebuild, play around, and most importantly, have fun!

## Why It Exists

Getting machine learning running inside TouchDesigner can feel overwhelming — especially when tutorials assume you already know Python, TensorFlow, or how to train your own neural net. This kit aims to simplify that.

- **No deep coding required**
- **No expensive hardware needed**
- Built for students, artists, and creative coders who want to experiment and build
